In brief, The file ```RANSAC.py``` performs these operations.

- Downsamples the point cloud by applying a Voxel Grid Filter.
- Apples a Pass Through Filter to isolate the table and objects.
- Performs RANSAC plane fitting to identify the table.
- Use the ExtractIndices Filter to create new point clouds containing the table and objects separately.

Each ```pcd file``` can be viewed uisng ```pcl_viewer <filename>.pcd```

## 1. VoxelGrid Downsampling Filter

A voxel grid filter allows you to downsample the data by taking a spatial average of the points in the cloud confined by each voxel. You can adjust the sampling size by setting the voxel size along each dimension. The set of points which lie within the bounds of a voxel are assigned to that voxel and statistically combined into one output point.

## 2. PassThrough Filter
The Pass Through Filter works much like a cropping tool, which allows you to crop any given 3D point cloud by specifying an axis with cut-off values along that axis. The region you allow to pass through, is often referred to as region of interest.

## 3. RANSAC Plane Fitting
First, a hypothetical shape of the desired model is generated by randomly selecting a minimal subset of n-points and estimating the corresponding shape-model parameters.

Once a model is established, the remaining points in the point cloud are tested against the resulting candidate shape to determine how many of the points are well approximated by the model.

After a certain number of iterations, the shape that possesses the largest percentage of inliers is extracted and the algorithm continues to process the remaining data

## 4. Outlier Removal Filter
It perform a statistical analysis in the neighborhood of each point, and remove those points which do not meet a certain criteria.

By assuming a Gaussian distribution, all points whose mean distances are outside of an interval defined by the global distances mean+standard deviation are considered to be outliers and removed from the point cloud.
